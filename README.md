# GeoPython

Exercise for Geo-Python 1 

This is code written for the first exercise of the [Geo-Python/AutoGIS course](https://github.com/Geo-Python-2021/Exercise-1). This is the first in a series of codes written as a part of post class exercises.

As someone who has not undertaken coding before, this took me approximately two hours to put together including figuring out how to use Jupyter Notebooks on my computer.
